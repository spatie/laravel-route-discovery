You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require spatie/laravel-route-discovery
```

## Publishing the config file

Optionally, you can publish the `route-discovery` config file with this command.

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="route-discovery-config"
```

This is the content of the published config file:

```php
return [
    /*
     * Routes will be registered for all controllers found in
     * these directories.
     */
    'discover_controllers_in_directory' => [
        // app_path('Http/Controllers'),
    ],

    /*
     * Routes will be registered for all views found in these directories.
     * The key of an item will be used as the prefix of the uri.
     */
    'discover_views_in_directory' => [
        // 'docs' => resource_path('views/docs'),
    ],

    /*
     * Default route names that will be automatically assigned to controller actions
     * when no explicit name is provided. The key is the method name and the value
     * is the default route name.
     *
     * For example, if you have a controller with a 'show' method, the default route
     * name will be 'show'. You can customize this by setting a different value:
     * 'show' => 'view'
     */
    'default_route_names' => [
        // 'action' => 'name',
    ],

    /*
     * After having discovered all controllers, these classes will manipulate the routes
     * before registering them to Laravel.
     *
     * In most cases, you shouldn't change these.
     */
    'pending_route_transformers' => [
        ...Spatie\RouteDiscovery\Config::defaultRouteTransformers(),
        //
    ],
];
```

## A word on performance

Discovering routes during each application request may have a small impact on performance. For increased performance, we highly recommend [caching your routes](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/routing#route-caching) as part of your deployment process.
